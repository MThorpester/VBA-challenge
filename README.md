# VBA-challenge
This project consists of a VBA script that loops through several years of stock data, summarizing each stock's activity for the year, and identifying stocks with extreme performance profiles. Screenshots of the script's output are included, and show the first page of the summary reports for each year's data, along with the signficant indicators.
